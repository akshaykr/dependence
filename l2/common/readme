I'm putting all main files and unit tests related to the L2-stuff here.

For now I have only clustering, but will also add classification and 2-sample
testing.

todo: kde creates a nxn matrix so don't use this for a large number of pts.
kde.m and spectralCluster.m were copied from my libs so they don't have
unit tests.
